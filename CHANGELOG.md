# Changelog

All notable changes to runtrol will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Entries are written from the user's point of view. Internal code names, plan numbers,
and refactoring that no user can observe do not belong here.

## [Unreleased]

Design phase. No release yet. The repository holds the North Star, the architecture
decisions with their measured evidence, and the gate harness. No product code exists.

### Added

- North Star with a scored checklist. Every axis starts at 0 because nothing is built,
  and a score only counts when a gate actually runs in CI.
- Architecture decisions across eight initiatives, each recorded with the measurement
  or source reading that produced it.
- Contract gates that run before any product code exists: workspace hygiene, forbidden
  folder names, silent failure detection with a self test, and AI attribution blocking.
- A scoreboard that computes rather than declares. Each axis score is derived from a base
  evidence tier, additives that only attach once the evidence is real and complete, and caps
  for gates that skipped or that nothing runs. The README in all four languages is held to
  the computed board, so a translated copy cannot keep yesterday's number.

- The logo, as vectors. A symbol, a wordmark, and three lockups in SVG, plus the favicon,
  app icon, tray icon, and social card sizes that cannot be vectors. The mark keeps one
  colour on light and dark backgrounds, so only the wordmark has a theme variant.

### Changed

- Modularity, clean code, security, hygiene, and budget are named gates on a pass or fail
  board instead of prose. They are deliberately not worth points: a floor rule at 7 out of 10
  is a floor rule being broken, and a total that rises without the user receiving anything is
  the inflation the scoreboard exists to prevent.
